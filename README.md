# Swiftcord - A Discord Library for Swift

## Requirements
1. macOS, Linux, iOS, watchOS, tvOS (no voice for iOS, watchOS, or tvOS)
2. At least Swift 5.3

## Adding Sword
### Swift Package Manager
In order to add Sword as a dependency, you must first create a Swift executable in a designated folder, like so `swift package init --type executable`. Then in the newly created Package.swift, open it and add Sword as a dependency

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 5.3

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "yourswiftexecutablehere",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/SketchMaster2001/Swiftcord", .branch("master"))
        // If you're using swift 5.5+, you need to use the following line instead:
        // .package(url: "https://github.com/SketchMaster2001/Swiftcord", branch: "master")
    ],
    targets: [
      .target(
        name: "yourswiftexecutablehere",
        dependencies: ["Swiftcord"]
      )
    ]
)
```

After that, open Sources/main.swift and remove everything and replace it with the example below.

```swift
import Swiftcord

let bot = Swiftcord(token: "Your bot token here", eventLoopGroup: nil)

// Set activity if wanted
let activity = Activities(name: "with Swiftcord!", type: .playing)
bot.editStatus(status: .online, activity: activity)

// Set intents which are required
bot.setIntents(intents: .guildMessages)

class MyBot: ListenerAdapter {
    override func onMessageCreate(event: Message) async {
        if event.content == "!ping" {
            do {
                _ = try await event.reply(with: "Pong!")
            } catch {
                print(error)
            }
        }
    }
}

bot.addListeners(MyBot())
bot.connect()
```
For more examples, look in the examples folder or in the Wiki.


## Running the bot (SPM)
First make sure you are in the directory with the `Package.swift` file. To build the executable, run `swift build`. To build the executable and run it immediately, run `swift run`

## Running the bot in Xcode (SPM)
To run the bot in Xcode, all you need to do is open the directory the `Package.swift` file is located in Xcode. Click the play button at the top left corner and it will run!

Then click the play button!
